**Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢**

A machine learning project that predicts survival of passengers on the Titanic disaster using supervised learning algorithms.

**📚 Project Description**

This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, sex, ticket class, etc.
It covers data exploration, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.
